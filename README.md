PLEASE READ***

This github repository has a references my other repository because I created my own repository before realizing I had to create a repo through the class. I tried for hours to push my android studio code to the new repo but this was the only was I could get my code on the new repo, as once I pushed to github I could not change where it was going.

This is a link to my first repository, where everything was originally uploaded:
